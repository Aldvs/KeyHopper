## Simple password manager with native russian cryptography. 
### Initially, this pet project was my master's thesis. It has a symmetric block crypto algorithm "Grasshopper" (GOST R 34.12-2015) and native SHA256 from CryptoKit.
### Stack:
1. Storyboards
2. Storage: CoreData
3. Cryptography: SHA256(CryptoKit), and implementation of GOST R 34.12-2015
